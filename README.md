# Web-controlled-IoT-based-6DOF-Robotic-Arm-using-ESP32
IoT-Based Robotic Arm using ESP32 This project demonstrates how to build and control a robotic arm wirelessly using an ESP32 microcontroller and a custom web interface. The system allows for remote control of the arm's movements over a local Wi-Fi network, without needing an internet connection.
